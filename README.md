# Overview of Sunbird UCI

`Everyone needs nudges to get something done, whether it is a student prepping for an examination or a district official assessing state of education in their district or a youngster looking for a job.`

Unified Communications Interface (UCI) is an open source platform that enables exactly this - a configurable platform to enable personalised chatbot nudges and micro experiences across channels such as WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, email and more. With UCI you can plugin any federated set of users, any micro experience generating transformers and any distribution channel adapters.

UCI powers governments to create and manage conversations with citizens and with its own officials. Through UCI governments can seamlessly setup simple and complex conversations using a multi-channel approach.
