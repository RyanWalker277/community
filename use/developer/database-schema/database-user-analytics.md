# Database Schema

### Introduction
This database is built using PostgreSQL, and its primary role is to keep track of the delivery status of notifications and their current status. It helps us generate final reports that show which notifications were sent, which users received them, and which users clicked on them. We use this database to store information about messages that were successfully delivered and messages that were read by users.
