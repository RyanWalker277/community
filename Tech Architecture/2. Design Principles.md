# Design Principles

1. Minimal specification
2. Utilize existing open-source services/infrastructure built by the community
3. Create small non-opinionated components for extensibility. (Manage diversity and complexity internally)
4. Small independent services that can be easily maintained/replaced
5. Interoperability using specifications
6. Ensure privacy and security
7. KISS
